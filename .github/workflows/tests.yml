###
# Important notes on GitHub actions:
#
# - We only get 2,000 free minutes a month (private repos)
# - We only get 500MB of artifact storage
# - Cache storage is limited to 7 days and 5GB.
# - macOS minutes are 10x as expensive as Linux minutes
# - windows minutes are twice as expensive.
#
# So keep those workflows light.
#
# In December 2020, github only supports x86/64. If we wanted to test
# on other architectures, we can use docker emulation, but there's no
# native support.
#
# Another major downside: You can't just re-run the job for one part
# of the matrix. So if there's a transient test failure that hit, say, 3.8,
# to get a clean run every version of Python runs again. That's bad.

# TODO:
# * Use YAML syntax to share snippets, like the old .travis.yml did
# Sadly, as of 2021-02-01, Github Actions does not support anchors at
# all. Just having an anchor results in an error:
#
#   The workflow is not valid. .github/workflows/tests.yml: Anchors
#   are not currently supported. Remove the anchor 'an-strategy'
#
# The alternative of using composite actions doesn't work either,
# because composite actions are limited to running shell scripts.
# Steps in them can't call other actions with `uses:`, and nor can
# they be conditional with `if:`.
