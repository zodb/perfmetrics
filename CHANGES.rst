3.2.0 (2021-09-28)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.10.

- Drop support for Python 3.5.

- Add aarch64 binary wheels.

3.1.0 (2021-02-04)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.8 and 3.9.
- Move to GitHub Actions from Travis CI.
- Support PyHamcrest 1.10 and later. See `issue 26
  <https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/26>`_.
- The ``FakeStatsDClient`` for testing is now always true whether or
  not any observations have been seen, like the normal clients. See
  `issue <https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/23>`_.
- Add support for `StatsD sets
  <https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md#sets>`_,
  counters of unique events. See `PR 30 <https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/pull/30>`_.

3.0.0 (2019-09-03)
==================

- Drop support for EOL Python 2.6, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.

- Add support for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.

- Compile the performance-sensitive parts with Cython, leading to a
  10-30% speed improvement. See
  https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/17.

- Caution: Metric names are enforced to be native strings (as a result
  of Cython compilation); they've always had to be ASCII-only but
  previously Unicode was allowed on Python 2. This is usually
  automatically the case when used as a decorator. On Python 2 using
  ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` can cause problems
  (raising TypeError) when manually constructing ``Metric`` objects. A
  quick workaround is to set the environment variable
  ``PERFMETRICS_PURE_PYTHON`` before importing perfmetrics.

- Make decorated functions and methods configurable at runtime, not
  just compile time. See
  https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/11.

- Include support for testing applications instrumented with
  perfmetrics in ``perfmetrics.testing``. This was previously released
  externally as ``nti.fakestatsd``. See https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/9.

- Read the ``PERFMETRICS_DISABLE_DECORATOR`` environment variable when
  ``perfmetrics`` is imported, and if it is set, make the decorators ``@metric``,
  ``@metricmethod``, ``@Metric(...)`` and ``@MetricMod(...)`` return
  the function unchanged. This can be helpful for certain kinds of
  introspection tests. See https://github.com/zodb/perfmetrics/issues/15

2.0 (2013-12-10)
================

- Added the ``@MetricMod`` decorator, which changes the name of
  metrics in a given context. For example, ``@MetricMod('xyz.%s')``
  adds a prefix.

- Removed the "gauge suffix" feature. It was unnecessarily confusing.

- Timing metrics produced by ``@metric``, ``@metricmethod``, and
  ``@Metric`` now have a ".t" suffix by default to avoid naming
  conflicts.

1.0 (2012-10-09)
================

- Added 'perfmetrics.tween' and 'perfmetrics.wsgi' stats for measuring
  request timing and counts.

0.9.5 (2012-09-22)
==================

- Added an optional Pyramid tween and a similar WSGI filter app
  that sets up the Statsd client for each request.

0.9.4 (2012-09-08)
==================

- Optimized the use of reduced sample rates.

0.9.3 (2012-09-08)
==================

- Support the ``STATSD_URI`` environment variable.

0.9.2 (2012-09-01)
==================

- ``Metric`` can now be used as either a decorator or a context
  manager.

- Made the signature of StatsdClient more like James Socol's
  StatsClient.

0.9.1 (2012-09-01)
==================

- Fixed package metadata.

0.9 (2012-08-31)
================

- Initial release.
